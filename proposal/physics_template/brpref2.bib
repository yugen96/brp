abstract = {Nighttime polarimetric measurements are often obtained very close to the limits of the instrumental capabilities. It is important to be aware of the possible sources of spurious polarization, and to adopt data reduction techniques that best compensate for the instrumental effects intrinsic to the design of the most common polarimeters adopted for nighttime observations.We define a self-consistent framework starting from the basic definitions of the Stokes parameters, and we present an analytical description of the data reduction techniques commonly used with a polarimeter (consisting of a retarder wave plate and aWollaston prism) to explore their advantages and limitations. We first consider an ideal polarimeter in which all optical components are perfectly defined by their nominal char- acteristics. We then introduce deviations from the nominal behavior of the polarimetric optics, and develop an analytical model to describe the polarization of the outgoing radiation. We study and compare the results of two different data reduction methods, one based on the differences of the signals, and one based on their ratios, to evaluate the residual amount of spurious polarization. We show that data reduction techniques may fully compensate for small deviations of the polarimetric optics from their nominal values, although some important (first-order) corrections have to be adopted for linear polarization data.We include a detailed discussion of quality checking by means of null parameters.We present an application to data obtained with the FORS1 instrument of the ESOVLT, in which we have detected a significant amount of cross talk between circular and linear polarization.We show that this cross-talk effect is not due to the polarimetric optics themselves, but is most likely caused by spurious birefringence due to the instrument's collimator lens. 1.},

abstract = {The morphology of the X-ray and radio emitting features in the central {\$}\backslashsim{\$} 50 kpc region around the galaxy M87 strongly suggests that buoyant bubbles of cosmic rays (inflated by an earlier nuclear active phase of the galaxy) rise through the cooling gas at roughly half the sound speed. In the absence of strong surface tension, initially spherical bubbles will transform into tori as they rise through an external medium. Such structures can be identified in the radio images of the halo of M87. During their rise, bubbles will uplift relatively cool X-ray emitting gas from the central regions of the cooling flow to larger distances. This gas is colder than the ambient gas and has a higher volume emissivity. As a result, rising ``radio'' bubbles may be trailed by elongated X-ray features as indeed is observed in M87. We performed simple hydrodynamic simulations to qualitatively illustrate the evolution of buoyant bubbles in the M87 environment.},

abstract = {ROSAT HRI observations show complicated substructure in the X-ray surface brightness within {\$}\backslashsim{\$}5 arcminutes around NGC 1275 -- the dominant galaxy of the Perseus cluster. The typical amplitude of the variations is of the order of 30{\%} of the azimuthally averaged surface brightness at a given distance from NGC 1275. We argue that this substructure could be related to the activity of NGC 1275 in the past. Bubbles of relativistic plasma, inflated by jets, be forced to rise by buoyancy forces, mix with the ambient intracluster medium (ICM), and then spread. Overall evolution of the bubble may resemble the evolution of a hot bubble during a powerful atmospheric explosion. From a comparison of the time scale of the bubble inflation to the rise time of the bubbles and from the observed size of the radio lobes which displace the thermal gas, the energy release in the relativistic plasma by the active nucleus of NGC 1275 can be inferred. Approximate modeling implies a nuclear power output of the order of {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}45{\}}{\$} erg s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} averaged over the last {\$}\backslashsim 3{\~{}}10{\^{}}7{\$} years. This is comparable with the energy radiated in X-rays during the same epoch. Detailed measurements of the morphology of the X-ray structure, the temperature and abundance distributions with Chandra and XMM may test this hypothesis.},

These detections of CO(1-0), CO(2-1), CO(3-2) and CO(4-3) are consistent with the presence of a substantial mass of warm molecular gas (10{\^{}}9-11.5Mo) within 50kpc radius of the central galaxy. We present limits on thirteen other galaxies in similarly extreme cooling flow clusters. These results are consistent with the presence of a massive starburst in the central galaxy which warms a population of cold gas clouds producing both optical and NIR emission lines and significant CO line emission. Curiously, our CO detections are restricted to the lower radio power central galaxies. These are the first detections of molecular gas in a cooling flow other than NGC1275 in the Perseus cluster. As four of our targets have firm limits on their dust mass from SCUBA and the rest have crude limits from IRAS, we can calculate gas-to-dust ratios. Simple analysis indicates that the best secondary indicatorof molecular gas is optical line luminosity. We review the implications of these results and the prospects for observations in the near future.},

abstract = {The giant elliptical galaxy NGC 1275, at the centre of the Perseus cluster, is surrounded by a well-known giant nebulosity of emission-line filaments, which are plausibly about {\textgreater}10{\^{}}8 yr old. The filaments are dragged out from the centre of the galaxy by the radio bubbles rising buoyantly in the hot intracluster gas before later falling back. They act as dramatic markers of the feedback process by which energy is transferred from the central massive black hole to the surrounding gas. The mechanism by which the filaments are stabilized against tidal shear and dissipation into the surrounding 4x10{\^{}}7 K gas has been unclear. Here we report new observations that resolve thread-like structures in the filaments. Some threads extend over 6 kpc, yet are only 70 pc wide. We conclude that magnetic fields in the threads, in pressure balance with the surrounding gas, stabilize the filaments, so allowing a large mass of cold gas to accumulate and delay star formation.},

abstract = {Recent observations show that the cooling flows in the central regions of galaxy clusters are highly suppressed. Observed AGN-induced cavities/bubbles are a leading candidate for suppressing cooling, usually via some form of mechanical heating. At the same time, observed X-ray cavities and synchrotron emission point toward a significant non-thermal particle population. Previous studies have focused on the dynamical effects of cosmic-ray pressure support, but none have built successful models in which cosmic-ray heating is significant. Here we investigate a new model of AGN heating, in which the intracluster medium is efficiently heated by cosmic-rays, which are injected into the ICM through diffusion or the shredding of the bubbles by Rayleigh-Taylor or Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. We include thermal conduction as well. Using numerical simulations, we show that the cooling catastrophe is efficiently suppressed. The cluster quickly relaxes to a quasi-equilibrium state with a highly reduced accretion rate and temperature and density profiles which match observations. Unlike the conduction-only case, no fine-tuning of the Spitzer conduction suppression factor f is needed. The cosmic ray pressure, P{\_}c/P{\_}g {\textless}{\~{}} 0.1 and dP{\_}c/dr {\textless}{\~{}} 0.1 $\backslash$rho g, is well within observational bounds. Cosmic ray heating is a very attractive alternative to mechanical heating, and may become particularly compelling if GLAST detects the gamma-ray signature of cosmic-rays in clusters.},

abstract = {The discovery of extended, approximately spherical weak shock waves in the hot intercluster gas in Perseus and Virgo has precipitated the notion that these waves may be the primary heating process that explains why so little gas cools to low temperatures. This type of heating has received additional support from recent gasdynamical models. We show here that outward propagating, dissipating waves deposit most of their energy near the center of the cluster atmosphere. Consequently, if the gas is heated by (intermittent) weak shocks for several Gyrs, the gas within 30-50 kpc is heated to temperatures that far exceed observed values. This heating can be avoided if dissipating shocks are sufficiently infrequent or weak so as not to be the primary source of global heating. Local PV and viscous heating associated with newly formed X-ray cavities are likely to be small, which is consistent with the low gas temperatures generally observed near the centers of groups and clusters where the cavities are located.},

The most remarkable structures are depressions in the X-ray surface brightness, {\$}\backslashsim 25-35{\$} kpc diameter, that are coincident with Hydra A's radio lobes. The depressions are nearly devoid of X-ray-emitting gas, and there is no evidence for shock-heated gas surrounding the radio lobes. We suggest the gas within the surface brightness depressions was displaced as the radio lobes expanded subsonically, leaving cavities in the hot atmosphere. The gas temperature declines from 4 keV at 70 kpc to 3 keV in the inner 20 kpc of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), and the cooling time of the gas is {\$}\backslashsim 600{\$} Myr in the inner 10 kpc. These properties are consistent with the presence of a {\$}\backslashsim 34 \backslashmsunyr{\$} cooling flow within a 70 kpc radius. Bright X-ray emission is present in the BCG surrounding a recently-accreted disk of nebular emission and young stars. The star formation rate is commensurate with the cooling rate of the hot gas within the volume of the disk, although the sink for the material cooling at larger radii remains elusive.},

abstract = {The quasi-stellar object (QSO)/merger Mrk 231 is arguably the nearest and best laboratory for studying QSO feedback. It hosts several outflows, including broad-line winds, radio jets, and a poorly-understood kpc scale outflow. In this Letter, we present integral field spectroscopy from the Gemini telescope that represents the first unambiguous detection of a wide-angle, kpc scale outflow from a powerful QSO. Using neutral gas absorption, we show that the nuclear region hosts an outflow with blueshifted velocities reaching 1100 km/s, extending 2-3 kpc from the nucleus in all directions in the plane of the sky. A radio jet impacts the outflow north of the nucleus, accelerating it to even higher velocities (up to 1400 km/s). Finally, 3.5 kpc south of the nucleus, star formation is simultaneously powering an outflow that reaches more modest velocities of only 570 km/s. Blueshifted ionized gas is also detected around the nucleus at lower velocities and smaller scales. The mass and energy flux from the outflow are {\textgreater}{\~{}}2.5 times the star formation rate and {\textgreater}{\~{}}0.7{\%} of the active galactic nucleus luminosity, consistent with negative feedback models of QSOs.},

@article{Ruszkowski2003,
abstract = {We simulate the effects of viscous dissipation of waves that are generated by AGN activity in clusters of galaxies. We demonstrate that the amount of viscous heating associated with the dissipation of these waves can offset radiative cooling rates in cooling flow clusters of galaxies. This heating mechanism leads to spatially distributed and approximately symmetrical dissipation. The heating waves reach a given distance from the cluster center on a timescale shorter than the cooling time. This means that this heating mechanism has the potential of quenching cooling flows in a quasi-stable fashion. Moreover, the heating is gentle as no strong shocks are present in the simulations. We first investigated whether a single continuous episode of AGN activity can lead to adequate dissipation to balance cooling rates. These simulations demonstrated that, whereas secondary waves generated by the interaction of the rising bubble with the intracluster medium are clearly present, viscous heating associated with the dissipation of these waves is insufficient to balance radiative cooling. It is only when the central source is intermittent that the viscous dissipation of waves associated with subsequent episodes of activity can offset cooling. This suggests that the ripples observed in the Perseus cluster can be interpreted as being due to the AGN duty cycle, i.e., they trace AGN activity history. The simulations were performed using the PPM adaptive mesh refinement code FLASH in two dimensions.},

@article{Sanderson2008,
abstract = {We investigate the thermodynamic and chemical structure of the intracluster medium (ICM) across a statistical sample of 20 galaxy clusters analysed with the Chandra X-ray satellite. In particular, we focus on the scaling properties of the gas density, metallicity and entropy and the comparison between clusters with and without cool cores (CCs). We find marked differences between the two categories except for the gas metallicity, which declines strongly with radius for all clusters (Z ∝ r −0.31), outside ∼0.02r 500 . The scaling of gas entropy is non-self-similar and we find clear evidence of bimodality in the distribution of logarithmic slopes of the entropy profiles. With only one exception, the steeper sloped entropy profiles are found in CC clusters whereas the flatter slope population are all non-CC clusters. We explore the role of thermal conduction in stabilizing the ICM and conclude that this mechanism alone is sufficient to balance cooling in non-CC clusters. However, CC clusters appear to form a distinct population in which heating from feedback is required in addition to conduction. Under the assumption that non-CC clusters are thermally stabilized by conduction alone, we find the distribution of Spitzer conduction suppression factors, f c , to be log-normal, with a log (base 10) mean of −1.50 ± 0.03 (i.e. f c = 0.032) and log standard deviation 0.39 ± 0.02.},

@article{Tombesi2011,
abstract = {X-ray absorption line spectroscopy has recently shown evidence for previously unknown Ultra-fast Outflows (UFOs) in radio-quiet AGNs. In the previous paper of this series we defined UFOs as those absorbers with an outflow velocity higher than 10,000km/s and assessed the statistical significance of the associated blueshifted FeK absorption lines in a large sample of 42 local radio-quiet AGNs observed with XMM-Newton. In the present paper we report a detailed curve of growth analysis and directly model the FeK absorbers with the Xstar photo-ionization code. We confirm that the frequency of sources in the radio-quiet sample showing UFOs is {\textgreater}35{\%}. The outflow velocity distribution spans from $\backslash$sim10,000km/s ($\backslash$sim0.03c) up to $\backslash$sim100,000km/s ($\backslash$sim0.3c), with a peak and mean value of $\backslash$sim42,000km/s ($\backslash$sim0.14c). The ionization parameter is very high and in the range log$\backslash$xi 3-6erg s{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} cm, with a mean value of log$\backslash$xi 4.2 erg s{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} cm. The associated column densities are also large, in the range N{\_}H$\backslash$sim10{\^{}}{\{}22{\}}-10{\^{}}{\{}24{\}} cm{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}, with a mean value of N{\_}H$\backslash$sim10{\^{}}{\{}23{\}} cm{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}. We discuss and estimate how selection effects, such as those related to the limited instrumental sensitivity at energies above 7keV, may hamper the detection of even higher velocities and higher ionization absorbers. We argue that, overall, these results point to the presence of extremely ionized and possibly almost Compton thick outflowing material in the innermost regions of AGNs. This also suggests that UFOs may potentially play a significant role in the expected cosmological feedback from AGNs and their study can provide important clues on the connection between accretion disks, winds and jets.},

abstract = {The analysis of Faraday rotation measurements (RM) gives insight into the properties of cluster magnetic fields. Recently, Kolmogorov-like magnetic turbulence was reported for the cool core of the Hydra A galaxy cluster which was derived using a maximum likelihood analysis of an RM map of this cluster (Vogt {\&} En{\ss}lin 2005). Here, we present our understanding of this power spectrum by kinetic energy injection through active galaxies which drive a turbulent non-helical magnetic dynamo. We develop an analytical model of the turbulence in cool cores and show that it fits well to Faraday rotation measurements for a number of cool core clusters. Moreover, our model allows predictions for magnetic fields in clusters in which the appropriate observational information is still missing, and allows predictions for yet unobserved quantities like the hydrodynamical turbulence velocity and characteristic length scale, and suggests some level of magnetic intermittency and large-scale hydrodynamic viscosity.},

abstract = {We present a simple model of hot gas in galaxy clusters, assuming hydrostatic equilibrium and energy balance between radiative cooling and thermal conduction. For five clusters, A1795, A1835, A2199, A2390 and RXJ1347.5-1145, the model gives a good description of the observed radial profiles of electron density and temperature, provided we take the thermal conductivity {\$}\backslashkappa{\$} to be about 30{\%} of the Spitzer conductivity. Since the required {\$}\backslashkappa{\$} is consistent with the recent theoretical estimate of Narayan {\&} Medvedev (2001) for a turbulent magnetized plasma, we consider a conduction-based equilibrium model to be viable for these clusters. We further show that the hot gas is thermally stable because of the presence of conduction. For five other clusters, A2052, A2597, Hydra A, Ser 159-03 and 3C295, the model requires unphysically large values of {\$}\backslashkappa{\$} to fit the data. These clusters must have some additional source of heat, most likely an active galactic nucleus since all the clusters have strong radio galaxies at their centers. We suggest that thermal conduction, though not dominant in these clusters, may nevertheless play a significant role by preventing the gas from becoming thermally unstable.},
